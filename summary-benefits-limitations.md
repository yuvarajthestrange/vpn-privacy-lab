## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of VPN Usage

| Limitation                               | Description                                                                                                       |
| :--------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reduced Internet Speed**               | Encryption and rerouting traffic through a VPN server may result in slower connection speeds.                     |
| **Limited Free Tier Features**           | Free versions often have limited server options, speeds, or connection time restrictions.                         |
| **Potential VPN Blocks**                 | Some websites and services (e.g., banking, streaming platforms) actively block known VPN IP ranges.               |
| **No Protection Beyond VPN Tunnel**      | A VPN only secures traffic routed through its tunnel; malware or phishing attacks on your device remain a risk.   |
| **Reliance on VPN Provider's Integrity** | Trust must be placed in the VPN provider to handle your data responsibly (ProtonVPN has a strict no-logs policy). |
| **Legal and Policy Restrictions**        | VPN use is regulated or restricted in certain countries; users must comply with local laws.                       |

## üìä Conclusion

A VPN like ProtonVPN significantly enhances online privacy and security by encrypting internet traffic and masking IP addresses. It is a valuable tool for protecting sensitive data, maintaining anonymity, and accessing restricted content. However, it should not be considered a complete security solution ‚Äî users must remain vigilant against device-level threats, phishing attempts, and legal limitations.

When combined with responsible online behavior and additional security measures (e.g., antivirus software, secure browsers, strong passwords), a VPN greatly improves digital safety and privacy.
