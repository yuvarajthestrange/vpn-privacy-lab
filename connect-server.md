## Module 3: Connecting to a VPN Server Using ProtonVPN on Windows

---

### Objective

This module guides you through connecting to a ProtonVPN server using the Windows client, covering server selection, connection process, and verification of a secure connection.

---

### Importance of Connecting to a VPN Server

Connecting to a VPN server encrypts your internet traffic and masks your real IP address, providing privacy, security, and the ability to bypass geographic restrictions.

---

### Step-by-Step Guide to Connect to a VPN Server

#### Step 1: Launch ProtonVPN Client

* Open the ProtonVPN application from the Start menu or desktop shortcut.
* Log in with your ProtonVPN credentials if prompted.

---

#### Step 2: Explore the Server List

* On the main screen, you will see a list or map of VPN servers organized by country and server load.
* Servers are categorized by speed and specialty, e.g., **Secure Core**, **P2P**, or **Basic** servers.

---

#### Step 3: Choose a Server Location

* For optimal speed and latency, select a server geographically close to your location.
* Alternatively, choose a server based on your privacy or access needs (e.g., a US server for accessing US content).
* Click the country name or server to view available servers in that region.

---

#### Step 4: Initiate the VPN Connection

* Click the **Connect** button next to your chosen server or use the **Quick Connect** feature to let ProtonVPN automatically connect to the fastest available server.
* The client will attempt to establish a secure connection.

---

#### Step 5: Confirm Connection Status

* Once connected, the client interface will show a **Connected** status, the server location, and your new IP address.
* The connection icon will turn green, and connection details will be visible (protocol used, connection time).
* System tray icon changes to indicate an active VPN session.

---

#### Step 6: Use Advanced Connection Features (Optional)

* **Kill Switch:** Enable this feature in settings to block internet traffic if the VPN connection drops, preventing IP leaks.
* **Auto-Connect:** Configure the client to connect automatically on startup or on untrusted networks.
* **Protocol Selection:** Change VPN protocol (OpenVPN, WireGuard) in settings for speed or security preferences.

---

### Troubleshooting Common Connection Issues

* **Connection Fails or Times Out:**

  * Switch to a different server or country.
  * Restart the ProtonVPN client or your PC.
  * Ensure your internet connection is stable.
* **Authentication Errors:**

  * Verify your login credentials.
  * Reset your ProtonVPN password if necessary.
* **Firewall or Antivirus Blocking:**

  * Temporarily disable third-party firewall or antivirus software and try again.
  * Add ProtonVPN to the whitelist/exclusion list.

---

### Verification of Connection

* Verify your IP address and location via [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) or similar services to confirm the VPN IP has replaced your original IP.
* Confirm your traffic is encrypted by visiting secure HTTPS websites and checking the connection padlock.

### Summary

Connecting to a ProtonVPN server is straightforward via the Windows client, allowing you to secure your internet traffic and enhance privacy. This module completes the essential step of establishing a VPN connection.
