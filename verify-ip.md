## Module 4: Verifying Your IP Address After Connecting to ProtonVPN on Windows

---

### Objective

This module explains how to verify that your IP address has changed successfully after connecting to a ProtonVPN server, confirming that your VPN connection is active and masking your real IP.

---

### Why Verify Your IP Address?

Confirming your IP address change ensures:

* Your internet traffic is being routed through the VPN server.
* Your real IP address is hidden, enhancing privacy.
* You can bypass geo-restrictions and access region-specific content.

---

### Step-by-Step Verification Guide

#### Step 1: Note Your Original IP Address (Before VPN Connection)

* Before connecting to the VPN, open your web browser.
* Visit an IP lookup website, such as:

  * [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)
  * [https://ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io)
* Note down your **original IP address** and the approximate location displayed.
* Take a screenshot of this page (e.g., `ip_before.png`).

---

#### Step 2: Connect to ProtonVPN Server

* Connect to your chosen ProtonVPN server as detailed in the previous module (`03-connect-server.md`).

---

#### Step 3: Verify the New IP Address

* After connecting, revisit the IP lookup website (refresh the page if already open).
* Confirm the IP address displayed is different from your original IP.
* Check the location of the new IP; it should correspond to the VPN server’s country.
* Take a screenshot showing your **new IP address** and location (e.g., `ip_after.png`).

---

#### Step 4: Confirm IP Change

* The displayed IP address should no longer be your original public IP but rather an IP assigned by the VPN server.
* If the IP remains the same, the VPN connection may not be active or configured correctly. Reconnect or troubleshoot as needed.

---

### Optional: Use Multiple IP Lookup Tools

For higher confidence, check your IP with multiple services:

* [https://ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net)
* [https://dnsleaktest.com](https://dnsleaktest.com)

This helps detect potential DNS leaks or incomplete masking.

### Summary

Verifying the IP address after connecting to ProtonVPN is a crucial step to ensure your VPN is functioning properly, masking your real IP and enhancing your privacy and security online.
